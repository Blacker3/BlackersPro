	<h1>Optical Detectors</h1>
	<div class="box">
		<p>Detectors perform the opposite function of light emitters. They convert optical signals back into electrical impulses that are used by the receiving end of the fiber optic data, video, or audio link. The most common detector is the semiconductor photodiode, which produces current in response to incident light.</p>

	<h2>Types</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Photon detectors </li>
			<li> Thermal detectors</li> 
		
		</ul>
</div>

<div class="box">
	
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Photon detectors </h3></li>
			<p>Photon or Quantum detectors generate a single response element for a single photon in response to the incoming photon flux. They respond in a quantized manner. Insufficiencies of response need to be accounted for, as it is hard to find perfect conditions in nature.</p><br>
			<p>The single response elements can assume different forms, such as a photomultiplier tube; a photoelectron in a detector consisting of photoemissive sensors; an electron-hole pair separating in a junction photodiode, which is the principle of operation of silicon detectors; or an electron that is elevated from valance band to conduction band in photoconductors. This causes a change in voltage level or current flow, which can then be processed by electronics, such as amplifiers, into a recording or display.</p>
		
		</ul>
</div>

<div class="box">
	
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Thermal detectors.</h3></li>
			<p>A heat detector is a fire alarm device designed to respond when the convected thermal energy of a fire increases the temperature of a heat sensitive element. The thermal mass and conductivity of the element regulate the rate flow of heat into the element. All heat detectors have this thermal lag.</p>
		
		</ul>
</div>


<div class="box">
	
		<ul>
			<li><h3 style="color:#e8682a; font-style: italic;">Difference Between Thermal and Photon Detectors</h3></li>
			<p>Thermal detectors are responsive to heat, meaning that the level of response will be the same for 200nm UV photons delivering 1W, and 10Âµm infrared photons delivering 1W. Conversely, photon detectors, at most, generate only one response element per incident photon before any amplification.</p><br>

<p>The energy carried by each photon varies inversely with its wavelength. Hence, the photon flux in the UV is much lower than in the IR for the same radiant power. Consequently, the responsivity of the photon detector, in terms of V/W or A/W, is much lower in the UV region than in the IR region of the spectrum.</p>
