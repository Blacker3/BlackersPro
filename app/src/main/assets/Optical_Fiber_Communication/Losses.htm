			<li><h3>Scattering Losses</h3></li>
			<p>Image result for Scattering Losses,
scattering. By Vangie Beal In fiber optic transmissions, scattering is the loss of signal caused by the diffusion of a light beam, where the diffusion itself is caused by microscopic variations in the transmission medium. Scattering typically happens when a light signal hits an impurity in the fiber.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><h3>Radiation losses.</h3></li>
			<p> Radiation losses often determine the maximum achievable energy in a charged particle accelerator. ... Typical energy gains are less that 10 MeV/meter. It follows, therefore, that radiation losses are completely negligible in linear accelerators, whether for electrons, or for other heavier particles</p>

			<li><h3>Connector losses in optical fiber</h3></li>
			<p> 
For single mode fiber, the fusion splicing loss typically can be less than 0.05 dB. Connector losses or insertion losses in optical fiber, are the losses of light power resulting from the insertion of a device in a transmission line or optical fiber. Multimode connectors will have losses of 0.2-0.5 dB (0.3 typical)</p>
		</ul>

	<div class="box">
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Bending Losses</h3></li>
			<p> Bending losses  The loss which exists when an optical fiber undergoes bending is called bending losses.  There are two types of bending i) Macroscopic bending Bending in which complete fiber undergoes bends which causes certain modes not to be reflected and therefore causes loss to the cladding.</p>
		</ul>
