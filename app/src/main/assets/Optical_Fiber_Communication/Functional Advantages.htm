	<h1>Functional Advantages & Disadvantage , Applications</h1>
	<div class="box">
		<h3>Functional Advantages</h3>
<p>The functional advantages of optical fibers are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The transmission bandwidth of the fiber optic cables is higher than the metal cables.</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of data transmission is higher in fiber optic cables.</p></li>
<li><p>The power loss is very low and hence helpful in long-distance transmissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiber optic cables provide high security and cannot be tapped.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiber optic cables are the most secure way for data transmission.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiber optic cables are immune to electromagnetic interference.</p></li>
<li><p>These are not affected by electrical noise.</p></li>
</ul>

		<h3>Physical Advantages</h3>
<p>The physical advantages of fiber optic cables are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The capacity of these cables is much higher than copper wire cables.</p></li>
<li><p>Though the capacity is higher, the size of the cable doesnâ€™t increase like it does in copper wire cabling system.</p></li>
<li><p>The space occupied by these cables is much less.</p></li>
<li><p>The weight of these FOC cables is much lighter than the copper ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Since these cables are di-electric, no spark hazards are present.</p></li>
<li><p>These cables are more corrosion resistant than copper cables, as they are bent easily and are flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>The raw material for the manufacture of fiber optic cables is glass, which is cheaper than copper.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiber optic cables last longer than copper cables.</p></li>
</ul>

	<div><h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<p>Although fiber optics offer many advantages, they have the following drawbacks &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Though fiber optic cables last longer, the installation cost is high.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of repeaters are to be increased with distance.</p></li>
<li><p>They are fragile if not enclosed in a plastic sheath. Hence, more protection is needed than copper ones.</p></li>
</ul></div>

<div><h3>Applications of Fiber Optics</h3>
<p>The optical fibers have many applications. Some of them are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Used in telephone systems</p></li>
<li><p>Used in sub-marine cable networks</p></li>
<li><p>Used in data link for computer networks, CATV Systems</p></li>
<li><p>Used in CCTV surveillance cameras</p></li>
<li><p>Used for connecting fire, police, and other emergency services.</p></li>
<li><p>Used in hospitals, schools, and traffic management systems.</p></li>
<li><p>They have many industrial uses and also used for in heavy duty constructions.</p></li>
</ul>
