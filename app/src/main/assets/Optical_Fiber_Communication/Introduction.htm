Fiber-optic communication is a method of transmitting information from one place to another by sending pulses of light through an optical fiber. The light forms an electromagnetic carrier wave that is modulated to carry information.[1] Fiber is preferred over electrical cabling when high bandwidth, long distance, or immunity to electromagnetic interference are required.</p>

<h3>Historical perspective</h3>


<p>First developed in the 1970s, fiber-optics have revolutionized the telecommunications industry and have played a major role in the advent of the Information Age. Because of its advantages over electrical transmission, optical fibers have largely replaced copper wire communications in core networks in the developed world.</p>

The process of communicating using fiber-optics involves the following basic steps:
<ol>
<li>creating the optical signal involving the use of a transmitter,[3] usually from an electrical signal</li>
<li>relaying the signal along the fiber, ensuring that the signal does not become too distorted or weak</li>
<li>receiving the optical signal</li>
<li>converting it into an electrical signal</li>
</ol>

<p>Optical fiber was successfully developed in 1970 by Corning Glass Works, with attenuation low enough for communication purposes (about 20 dB/km) and at the same time GaAs semiconductor lasers were developed that were compact and therefore suitable for transmitting light through fiber optic cables for long distances.</p>
<h3>The second generation of fiber-optic communication </h3>
<p>The second generation of fiber-optic communication was developed for commercial use in the early 1980s, operated at 1.3 µm and used InGaAsP semiconductor lasers. These early systems were initially limited by multi mode fiber dispersion, and in 1981 the single-mode fiber was revealed to greatly improve system performance, however practical connectors capable of working with single mode fiber proved difficult to develop. </p>
<h3>Third-generation</h3>
<p>Third-generation fiber-optic systems operated at 1.55 µm and had losses of about 0.2 dB/km. This development was spurred by the discovery of Indium gallium arsenide and the development of the Indium Gallium Arsenide photodiode by Pearsall. Engineers overcame earlier difficulties with pulse-spreading at that wavelength using conventional InGaAsP semiconductor lasers. Scientists overcame this difficulty by using dispersion-shifted fibers designed to have minimal dispersion at 1.55 µm or by limiting the laser spectrum to a single longitudinal mode. These developments eventually allowed third-generation systems to operate commercially at 2.5 Gbit/s with repeater spacing in excess of 100 km.</p>
<h3>The fourth generation </h3>
<p>The fourth generation of fiber-optic communication systems used optical amplification to reduce the need for repeaters and wavelength-division multiplexing to increase data capacity. These two improvements caused a revolution that resulted in the doubling of system capacity every six months starting in 1992 until a bit rate of 10 Tb/s was reached by 2001. In 2006 a bit-rate of 14 Tbit/s was reached over a single 160 km line using optical amplifiers.[11]</p>
