<p>C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO).</p>
<p>C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.</p>
<p>C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level languages on different computer platforms and architectures.</p>
<p>The following reasons make C# a widely used professional language:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>It is a modern, general-purpose programming language</li>
<li>It is object oriented.</li>
<li>It is component oriented.</li>
<li>It is easy to learn.</li>
<li>It is a structured language.</li>
<li>It produces efficient programs.</li>
<li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.</li>
<li>It is a part of .Net Framework.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strong Programming Features of C#</h2>
<p>Although C# constructs closely follow traditional high-level languages, C and C++ and being an object-oriented programming language. It has strong resemblance with Java, it has numerous strong programming features that make it endearing to a number of programmers worldwide.</p>
<p>Following is the list of few important features of C#:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Boolean Conditions</li>
<li>Automatic Garbage Collection</li>
<li>Standard Library</li>
<li>Assembly Versioning</li>
<li>Properties and Events</li>
<li>Delegates and Events Management</li>
<li>Easy-to-use Generics</li>
<li>Indexers</li>
