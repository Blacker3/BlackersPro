<p>Decision making structures requires the programmer to specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.</p>
<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages:</p>

<p>C# provides following types of decision making statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<p><a title="if statement in C#" href="10-1.html">if statement</a></p>

<td>An <strong>if statement</strong> consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><a title="if...else statement in C#" href="10-2.html">if...else statement</a></p>
</td>
<td>An <strong>if statement</strong> can be followed by an optional <strong>else statement</strong>, which executes when the boolean expression is false.</td>

<p><a title="nested if statements in C#" href="10-3.html">nested if statements</a></p>
</td>
<td>You can use one <strong>if</strong> or <strong>else if</strong> statement inside another <strong>if</strong> or <strong>else if</strong> statement(s).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a title="switch statement in C#" href="10-4.html">switch statement</a></p>
</td>
<td>A <strong>switch</strong> statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.</td>

<h2>The ? : Operator:</h2>
<p>We have covered <strong>conditional operator ? :</strong> in previous chapter which can be used to replace <strong>if...else</strong> statements. It has the following general form:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted"><span class="typ">Exp1</span> <span class="pun">?</span> <span class="typ">Exp2</span> <span class="pun">:</span> <span class="typ">Exp3</span><span class="pun">;</span></pre>
<p>Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.</p>
<p>The value of a ? expression is determined as follows: Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression. If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.</p>
